**If you've enough time then you can refer the above main page to get started for Data Structures and Algorithms
else the following topics works well.**


1) Asymptotic Analysis: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-1-asymptotic-analysis/
2) Worst, Average and Best Case: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-2-asymptotic-analysis/

4) Solving Recurrences: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-algorithm-set-4-master-method-solving-recurrences/
5) Amortized Algorithms: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-algorithm-set-5-amortized-analysis-introduction/
6) Space Complexity: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-86/

**By this time you should understand the significance of Big O and the difference between Big O, Omega and Theta and where to use them. 

**How to find out the time complexities of recursion algorithms?
